# Plotter

Hi, here i made a web based app for controlling a home-made plotter. 

The hardware is composed by an arduino, an adafruit shield, two steppers and a micro servo.

Here is the a post in Taringa with some information about it.

The web app is written in node.js with some libraries and mongodb.
